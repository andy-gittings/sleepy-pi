# Pi Audio Player

Pi project for playing random audio files (continuously) - except when connected via shairport-sync connection which overrides currently playing file. When shairport-sync session becomes inactive, random file playback resumes.

Code assumes files are located under ``/audio`` (and playable by cvlc). Control file ``/tmp/airplay-playing`` generated by shairport-sync config.

Build file and config for shairport-sync in ``build/buid.sh`` and ``etc/shairport-sync.conf`` respectively.

``systemd`` control files for both shairport-sync and the audio player: ``systemd/shairport-sync.service`` and ``systemd/playfile.service``
